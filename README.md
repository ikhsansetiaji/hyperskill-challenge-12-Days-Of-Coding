# 🎄 Twelve Days of Coding — Hyperskill Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the **“Twelve Days of Coding”** challenge by **Hyperskill**  
(originally themed around _North Pole Technologies_).

This repository documents my personal learning journey while solving all **12 programming challenges**,
one per day, using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📖 Challenge Story

Welcome to your new job at **North Pole Technologies**, your best provider of every winter holiday!

Each day, the team lead, **Mr. Frost**, assigns a new programming challenge inspired by the lyrics of the
classic holiday song _“The Twelve Days of Christmas”_.  
These tasks focus on algorithmic thinking, data processing, and clean problem-solving.
